## Review Scope

### Architecture Patterns
<!-- Core architectural patterns; deviations need justification -->

### Project Conventions
<!-- Style guides, naming conventions, file organization rules -->

### Critical Paths
<!-- Files that affect many others; changes here need careful review -->

### Security-Sensitive
<!-- Authentication, authorization, input validation, data handling -->

### Performance-Critical
<!-- Hot paths, frequently called code, resource-intensive operations -->

### Public API Surface
<!-- Exported interfaces, public methods, external contracts -->

### State Management
<!-- Global state, caches, session handling, data persistence -->

### Configuration
<!-- Environment configs, feature flags, secrets handling -->

### Package Adherence
<!-- Installed packages that must be used; no custom alternatives -->

### External Dependencies
<!-- Third-party integrations, API clients, SDK usage -->
